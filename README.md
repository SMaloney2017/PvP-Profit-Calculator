## PvP-Profit-Calculator
A "Loot Tracker"-like plugin for logging PvP kills/ deaths in RuneLite as well as returning useful information
such as world type, skull status, protect item, K/D Ratio, and profit gained/ lost.

### Goals
- ✓ Show basic world information, skull status, item protection, and current opponent
- ✓ Log items lost per pvp death
- ✓ Log loot gained from player kill
- ✓ Calculate K/D Ratio
- ✓ Calculate Profit gained/ Lost

### Bugs to fix/ Concerns
- 📓 Not certain to function correctly in multi or when multiple others are interacting with the user at their death (eg. following, trading, attacking).
- 🐞 K/D and deaths are only changed when you lose items (eg. no death count when nothing lost). -> Intend to fix so the plugin can still be useful for minigame combat such as LMS or Clan Wars.
