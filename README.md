## PvP-Profit-Calculator
A "Loot Tracker"-like plugin for logging PvP kills/ deaths in RuneLite as well as returning useful information
such as world type, skull status, protect item, K/D Ratio, and profit gained/ lost.

Works in all normal use cases during singles combat although bugs while determining interactions occur. 

### Goals
- ✓ Show basic world information, skull status, and item protection
- ✓ Log items lost per death
- ✓ Log loot gained from player kill
- ✓ Calculate K/D Ratio
- ✓ Calculate Profit gained/ Lost

### Bugs/ Concerns
- Not certain to function correctly in multi or when multiple others are interacting with the user at their death (eg. following, trading, attacking).
- K/D and deaths are only changed when you lose items (eg. no death count when nothing lost).
